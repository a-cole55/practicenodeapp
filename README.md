Node.js Server Practice

This fun and cool project is the result of me playing around with Node.js (no Express, just yet). I practiced hosting different projects and trending codepen projects.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Heroku

I'm still playing around with the functionality of Node.js. I was able to host a beauty site that I previously created, link here: https://glamourb.netlify.app/ and a few trending projects from codepen. I'm now moving into more backend projects so the focus here was not the projects themselves but the ability to navigate a site or various pages with the server side code.

Optimizations
N/A

Lessons Learned:
The process of learning and navigating Node is a lot of fun and also intimidating. I quickly realized that it's easy to make an error when hosting images/files (a simple miss of a "/" can  leave you debugging for hours!). I'm looking forward to adding Express to the miss to simplify the code and speed up the functionality of my sites.

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
